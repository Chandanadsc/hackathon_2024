figure illustrates highlevel architecture system
figure architecture intelligent study guide system document ingestion preprocessing system accepts various document type input pdf file microsoft word document docx powerpoint presentation ppt pptx youtube video link plain text file txt langchain employed handle preprocessing diverse document type
textbased document langchain extract clean text content
youtube video audio first transcribed converted text
text embedding document preprocessed converted text system us openais api generate embeddings text content
embeddings dense vector representation capture semantic meaning text allowing efficient similarity search later process
vector database storage generated embeddings stored vector database allows fast efficient similarity search
database serf knowledge base study guide system containing semantic representation uploaded document
query processing user submits query system performs following step query filtering input preprocessed removing common word stop word etc reduce token usage focus significant term
query embedding filtered query converted embedding using openai api used document embedding
similarity search system performs similarity search vector database find relevant content based query embedding
response generation using retrieved relevant content original query llm generates contextually appropriate response
figure query processing workflow methodology document processing langchain langchain provides unified interface processing various document type
textbased document pdfs word document plain text langchain extract text content performs necessary cleaning operation removing special character normalizing whitespace
powerpoint presentation langchain extract text slide including speaker note available
ensures important context presentation captured knowledge base
youtube video processing involves additional step audio transcription
langchain integrates transcription service convert video audio con tent text processed similarly textbased document
text embedding openai api system us openais text embedding api convert processed text dense vector representation
embeddings capture semantic meaning text allowing nuanced similarity comparison simple keyword matching
choice openais embedding model ensures highquality representation capture complex relationship concept crucial educational content understanding context connection important
vector database implementation vector database critical component system enabling efficient storage retrieval embedded document content
choice vector database depends factor expected volume data required query speed scalability need
common option include faiss efficient similarity search library developed facebook research
pinecone managed vector database service designed machine learning application
milvus opensource vector database support various index type different use case
figure vector database representation similarity query processing response generation query processing pipeline designed optimize efficiency relevance response stop word removal common word filtered reduce noise focus meaningful part query
query embedding filtered query embedded using openai api used document embedding ensuring consistency vector space
similarity search system performs knearest neighbor knn search vector database retrieve relevant document segment
context assembly retrieved segment combined original query create rich context llm
response generation llm generates response based assembled context providing personalized answer draw user uploaded document
literature survey large language model llm like gpt revolutionized interaction technology particularly education information retrieval
traditional keyword search often fail capture context whereas newer approach chat document concept proposed pathan
allow user engage document conversational manner enhancing retrieval specific insight
research van klompenburg
demonstrates machine learning accurately predict crop yield highlighting potential system trained large datasets provide personalized insight
similarly barvin sampradeepraj explored graphbased algorithm crop recommendation emphasizing significance understanding relationship data pointsan approach mirrored llm identify relevant information extensive content
optimize interaction many system utilize vector database store document dense vector capturing meaning rather word
method ensures quick relevant information retrieval
despite promise technology challenge ethical response privacy concern persist
application educational context intelligent study guide system several potential application educational setting personalized learning student upload course material lecture note additional resource create personalized knowledge base
system provide tailored explanation answer based specific content studying
exam preparation interacting chatbot student quiz course mate rial get explanation complex concept identify area require study
research assistance graduate student researcher use system quickly find relevant information large corpus academic paper research note aiding literature review hypothesis generation
continuous learning professional engaged continuous learning use system integrate knowledge various source online course industry report technical documentation retrieve relevant information demand
challenge limitation intelligent study guide system offer significant benefit also face several challenge content accuracy system relies accuracy uploaded document llm interpretation
error bias source material may propagated system response
context retention ensuring system maintains appropriate context across multiple turn conversation challenging especially dealing complex inter connected topic
handling ambiguity educational content often involves nuanced concept may require additional clarification
system must able recognize query ambiguous ask clarification necessary
privacy data security handling potentially sensitive educational material requires robust security measure protect user data comply relevant regulation ferpa united state
figure accuracy different model future direction several avenue future development research present multimodel learning incorporating image video understanding capability could allow system process reference visual content textbook diagram video lecture
collaborative learning feature implementing feature allow multiple user share collectively build knowledge base could enhance group study peer learning experience
adaptive questioning developing system ability ask followup question adapt response based user level understanding could create dynamic effective learning interaction
integration learning management system connecting study guide system existing educational platform could pro vide seamless access course material enable progress tracking
conclusion intelligent study guide system presented paper demonstrates potential combining large language model advanced document processing technique create personalized learning experience
allowing user upload diverse document type interact resulting knowledge base natural language query system offer novel approach studying information retrieval educational context
challenge remain particularly area accuracy context management data privacy potential benefit system significant
research natural language processing educational technology continues advance anticipate system like one described paper play increasingly important role supporting personalized efficient learning experience
